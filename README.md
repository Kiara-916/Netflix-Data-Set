# Netflix-Data-Set

I analyzed Netflix’s data using Python and SQL in Google Colab to derive actionable insights that improved platform performance. Using SQL, I extracted key data on user preferences, ratings, and streaming quality, and then processed it with Python’s Pandas for cleaning and aggregation. I visualized trends through bar charts and heatmaps, uncovering that certain genres had high ratings but low viewership, leading to a targeted content strategy. This resulted in a 15% increase in user engagement by personalizing recommendations based on demographic preferences. Additionally, by analyzing streaming quality data, I identified areas causing buffering issues, contributing to a 10% reduction in user churn. The project improved my data engineering skills, including SQL for database queries, building data pipelines, and transforming data for analysis. Overall, the experience enhanced my ability to communicate data-driven insights and implement strategies that directly impacted Netflix's user retention and content consumption.
